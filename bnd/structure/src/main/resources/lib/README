This directory is the standard Java classpath directory.
Any jar in this folder will be part of the main classloader used to load GATEWAY.
However, in OSGi, classes defined in these jars won't be available to other
bundles unless one of the org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra or
org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation properties in the etc/config.properties file
is modified to export or delegate the packages.
Please refer to the OSGi Core Specification for more information on these
properties and the OSGi classloading mechanism.
